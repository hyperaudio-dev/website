              <p><a href="http://hyperaud.io">Hyperaudio</a> is a term coined by <a href="http://twitter.com/moltke">Henrik Moltke</a>. After discovering we had similar interests we started working on the concept a while back, resulting in a few demos such as the <a href="http://hyper-audio.org/r/">Radiolab demo</a> for WNYC. That was a couple of years ago now. Since then I have been working with my colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/thePag">Mark Panaghiston</a> on various Hyperaudio demos and thinking about how we can create an suite of tools I&nbsp;imaginatively&nbsp;call the Hyperaudio Ecosystem, at the center of that ecosystem sits the Hyperaudio Pad.</p>

                <figcaption>Each component of the ecosystem is loosely coupled. The flow of data runs from left to right but can start from any of the Transcript tools or Hyperaudio Pad itself. Each component can be used as a standalone entity and comes complete with its own exposed API.

              <h2>What is Hyperaudio?</h2>
              <p>But hey, let’s back up a bit. What is this Hyperaudio of which I speak? Simply put, Hyperaudio aims to do for audio what hypertext did for text – that is to integrate audio fully into the web experience. <a href="http://blog.appsfuel.com/2012/08/30/what-is-hyperaudio/">I wrote more about that here.</a></p>
              <p>The Hyperaudio Pad is a tool that enables people to build up or remix audio and video using the underlying timed-transcripts. At the moment we’re concentrating on transcribing the spoken word.</p>
              <p>Over the last seven days or so me and the other Mark have been working fairly solidly on taking the Hyperaudio Pad to the next level. It’s great to work with Mark P for several reasons. Obviously as key author of jPlayer he knows pretty much all there is to know about web based media, but also although we are both developers we are in many ways diametrically opposed. Mark is keen on code quality and doing things properly and I just want to get things out there. Happily the compromise we arrive at when we work together is a usually a good one. Mark is coming around to minimal-viable solutions and I have to admit that doing things right can save time in the long-run.</p>
              <p>In fact there is a world of difference between earlier versions of the Hyperaudio Pad and that I largely developed and the version we have now after a week of collaboration.</p>
              <p>Putting our weird <a href="http://bizarrerecords.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/reneeRenat.jpg">Renée and Renato</a> relationship aside for a bit, let’s talk a little about what it is that the Hyperaudio Pad is actually meant to do.</p>
              <h2>The Power of the Remix</h2>
              <p>OK, so key aims here are really to encourage the remixing of media in a new and refreshingly easy way – in doing so promote media literacy. On the subject of remixing at its importance in counter-culture I’d encourage you to check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiP!:_A_Remix_Manifesto">RIP! : A Remix Manifesto</a> and the excellent <a href="http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/">Everything is a Remix</a> series.</p>
              <p>Actually Brett Gaylor of Remix Manifesto fame is doing similar work by leading the effort <a href="http://popcorn.webmadecontent.org/rd5">building sequencing</a> into <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/">Popcorn Maker</a>. We’re approaching the same objective from completely different angles.</p>
              <p>Although we use the Popcorn.js library at the heart of the Hyperaudio Pad, we use text to describe and represent media content. This may seem counter intuitive but actually transcripts can be a great way to navigate media content. Transcripts help break media out of it’s black box and we can scan and search through it relatively quickly. The Hyperaudio Pad borrows from the word-processor paradigm allowing people to copy blocks of transcript and associated media and further, allowing them to describe transitions, effects, adjust volumes using natural language that resemble editing directions in a script.</p>
              <h2>Media Literacy</h2>
              <p>As an example of some transitions and effects you can currently insert between clips:</p>
              <code>[fade through black over 2 seconds, apply effects nightvision, scanlines, tvglitch]</code>
              <p>…currently works.</p>
              <p>which is equivalent to:</p>
              <code>[fade black 2 apply nightvision scanlines tvglitch]</code>
              <p>but we want to encourage the user to be descriptive as these directions are both human and computer readable.</p>
              <p>Other effects include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>ascii</li>
                <li>colorcube</li>
                <li>emboss</li>
                <li>invert</li>
                <li>noise</li>
                <li>ripple</li>
                <li>scanlines</li>
                <li>sepia</li>
                <li>sketch</li>
                <li>vignette</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This system will evolve of course, and we hope to allow stuff like:</p>
              <code>[change volume to 50% over 3 seconds, change brightness to 20% over 2 seconds, play track 'love me do' from 30 seconds to 35 seconds, change track volume from 0 to 80% over 2 seconds]</code>
              <p>(stuff like that)</p>
              <p>Transcript snippets, combined with text described transitions and effects act as a kind of source code for the media.</p>
              <h2>Weak References</h2>
              <p>As cuts are nothing more than weak references to media files, start and end times and effects that are simply layered — in real-time — over the top, we can make additive remixes as easily as we can subtractive ones, that is to say, somebody could take a remix and enhance it by peeling back a specific snippet to reveal more, thereby adding to the piece.</p>
              <p>In fact a key goal here is to allow remixing of remixes.</p>
              <p>So a bit about more about the technology powering this. Effects are handled by <a href="https://twitter.com/bchirls">Brian Chirls</a>&rsquo; seriously cool Seriously.js – a comprehensive video compositing library. The great thing about <a href="http://seriouslyjs.org/">Seriously.js</a> is that it is a modular system. We can add effects (and load their code dynamically) as we go. I also look forward to using some of our experience gained with the Web Audio API to apply realtime audio effects. The wider vision is to make a system that will take raw media, transcribe it and allow you to do all the things you could do with a professional video editing package.</p>
              <p>We’ve got plenty more to do, certainly some bugs to iron out, but we’re steadily approaching beta. A lot has been restructured behind the scenes, giving us a more stable platform to build on and more quickly enhance. The question I posed and answered on Twitter. What do you call something between alpha and beta? Alpha.</p>
              <h2>Going Forward</h2>
              <p>We still plan to add the following features in the near future:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>alter brightness, contrast, saturation etc</li>
                <li>control and fade volume</li>
                <li>add audio track that can be played simultaneously or sequentially</li>
                <li>add effects/transitions in paragraph etc</li>
                <li>allow editing right down to the word, delete words</li>
                <li>allow fine tuning of start and end points</li>
                <li>allow the playback and sharing of fullscreen video remixes with an option to see the underlying ‘source code’.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you want to play around yourself you can find the <a href="http://happyworm.com/clientarea/hyperaudio/hap/latest/">latest demo here</a>.
              </p>
              <p><a href="https://github.com/maboa/hyperaudiopad">Sourcecode is on GitHub</a> (I should get around to adding an MIT license or something)</p>
              <p>Or you can watch a <a href="http://happyworm.com/screencams/hyperaudiopad/2013-04-04/demo1-standard.m4v">screen recording</a> of where we were at as of yesterday. Apologies for the choppy quality, oh and the background music, it seemed a good idea at the time.</p>
