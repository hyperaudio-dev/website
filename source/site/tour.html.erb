        <h2 class="feature-heading">The Hyperaudio Pad</h2>
        <div class="feature-text">
          <p>Putting your audio or video piece together has never been easier. Using a transcript to assemble a piece of media is pretty revolutionary and actually a lot of fun. Because you already know how to create things from text, it’s actually very easy to get up and running. The interface is minimal but don’t be fooled, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes. Check out other people’s mixes to see what can be done, remix them if you like - and easily publish and share them with a unique web address.</p>

You can start off a mix on your commute and finish it later on a computer of your choice in the comfort of your own home or office.</p>

        <div class="feature-text">
          <p>We provide a library full of already transcribed material, but you may want to transcribe your own material and this is where the Transcript Maker comes in handy. The Maker provides several options for people to create Hyperaudio compatible transcripts:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>If you already have the transcript, submit it with the media for time alignment for free.<sup>*</sup></li>
            <li>If you don’t have the transcript, you can create one with our handy tool then jump to step 1 above.</li>
            <li>If you have the media only we can submit it to our automatic speech recognition service. As there are humans involved in this process we need to pass the cost of 10 cents a minute over to you.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><sup>*</sup> It’s free if you make the transcript public, otherwise it’s 5 cents a minute.</p>
