        <div class="feature-text">
          <p>Putting your audio or video piece together has never been easier. Using a transcript to assemble a piece of media is pretty revolutionary and actually a lot of fun.</p>
          <p>Because you already know how to create things from text, it’s actually very easy to get up and running. The interface is minimal but don’t be fooled, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes. Check out other people’s mixes to see what can be done, remix them if you like - and easily publish and share them with a unique web address.</p>
